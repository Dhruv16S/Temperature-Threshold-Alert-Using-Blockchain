# Temperature-Threshold-Alert-Using-Blockchain
The application operates by activating a smart contract whenever the temperature surpasses the designated threshold. Within the smart contract, comprehensive records are stored, encompassing the dates and times on which the temperature exceeded the specified limit. Additionally, the application generates a comprehensive report, outlining the frequency with which the temperature exceeded the threshold.
